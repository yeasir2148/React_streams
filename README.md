# React_streams
A simple react app that enables you to view/access live streams. You can create your own stream(by using 3rd party application) and then make it available publicly
so that your **client** app can view it.

There are two parts of the application:
1. client - the actual app built with react
2. api server - an instance of the node *json server* package

Detail instructions available inside individual directories.
